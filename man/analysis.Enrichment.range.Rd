\title{Perform Enrichment Analysis Across a Range of Cluster Numbers}
\usage{
analysis.Enrichment.range(Xnew, n.clust = 10, nrep = 100, seed)
}
\arguments{
\item{Xnew}{A numeric matrix or data frame of observations.}

\item{n.clust}{The maximum number of clusters to test. The analysis will be
performed for \verb{k = 2, 3, ..., n.clust}.}

\item{nrep}{The number of permutations to perform in each call to \code{fit.enrichment}.}

\item{seed}{A random seed to ensure that the initial GMM fit is reproducible for
each number of clusters.}
}
\value{
A list of lists. The k-th element of the returned list (\code{result[[k]]}) contains
the full output from \code{fit.enrichment} for the k-cluster model. Elements for k < 2
will be \code{NULL}.
}
\description{
Systematically runs the permutation-based enrichment analysis for a
series of Gaussian Mixture Models with different numbers of clusters.
}
\details{
This function serves as a sensitivity analysis tool for cluster robustness. Instead of
evaluating a single clustering solution, it iterates through a range of cluster numbers
(from 2 to \code{n.clust}).

For each number of clusters \code{k} in the range, the function performs the following two steps:
\enumerate{
\item Fits a Gaussian Mixture Model with \code{k} components to the data (\code{mclust::Mclust}).
\item Immediately runs the statistical validation procedure (\code{fit.enrichment}) on that \code{k}-cluster model.
}

The results of each validation are stored in a list. This allows a user to compare not
only the number of significant clusters but also their enrichment scores and p-values
across different model complexities (i.e., different \code{k}). This approach helps in making a
more informed decision on the final number of clusters by assessing how the statistical
significance of cluster profiles changes as \code{k} is varied.
