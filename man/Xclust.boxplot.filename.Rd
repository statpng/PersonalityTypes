\title{Generate and Save Boxplots of Factor Scores by Cluster}
\usage{
Xclust.boxplot.filename(Xclust, wh.best, filename)
}
\arguments{
\item{Xclust}{A data frame with factor scores and a 'class' column for cluster assignments.}

\item{wh.best}{A numeric vector of length 2, containing the optimal number of clusters (\code{wh.best[1]}) and the corresponding random seed (\code{wh.best[2]}).}

\item{filename}{A base string for the output PDF file name.}
}
\value{
This function does not return a value. It saves a plot to a PDF file.
}
\description{
Creates a faceted boxplot to visualize the distribution of personality
factor scores for each identified cluster and saves it to a PDF file.
}
\details{
This function serves to interpret the results of a clustering analysis (e.g., GMM).
It takes a data frame \code{Xclust} where each row is an observation, columns represent
different factor scores (e.g., O, C, E, A, N), and a 'class' column indicates cluster membership.

The data is transformed into a long format, and \code{ggpubr::ggboxplot} is used to create
boxplots of scores for each factor. The plots are faceted by cluster (\code{facet.by="class"}),
allowing for a direct visual comparison of the personality profiles of the different clusters.
The resulting plot is saved as a PDF file, with a filename indicating the seed and number of clusters used.
