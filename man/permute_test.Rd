\title{Permutation Test for Compositional Regression Coefficients}
\usage{
permute_test(X_screen, y, rep, level)
}
\arguments{
\item{X_screen}{A numeric matrix of log-transformed compositional predictors.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector for the response variable.}

\item{rep}{The number of permutation replicates to perform.}

\item{level}{The significance level (alpha) for flagging results.}
}
\value{
A list containing data frames with calculated p-values and significance flags, based on both the beta coefficients and the t-statistics.
}
\description{
Performs a non-parametric permutation test to calculate empirical
p-values for the coefficients from a \code{CompReg} model.
}
\details{
This function assesses the statistical significance of each compositional predictor
without relying on the assumption of normally distributed errors. It works by:
\enumerate{
\item Calculating the observed coefficients (\code{beta_hat}) and t-statistics (\code{t_ref}) from the original data.
\item Creating a null distribution by repeatedly (\code{rep} times) shuffling the response variable \code{y}. This shuffling breaks the true relationship between predictors and response.
\item For each shuffled \code{y}, a new \code{CompReg} model is fitted, and its coefficients and t-statistics are stored.
\item The empirical p-value for each predictor is then calculated as the proportion of times the absolute value of the permuted statistic was greater than or equal to the absolute value of the observed statistic. A small p-value indicates that the observed relationship is unlikely to have occurred by chance.
