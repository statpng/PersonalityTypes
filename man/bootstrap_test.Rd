\title{Bootstrap Confidence Intervals for Compositional Regression Coefficients}
\usage{
bootstrap_test(X_screen, y, rep)
}
\arguments{
\item{X_screen}{A numeric matrix of log-transformed compositional predictors.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector for the response variable.}

\item{rep}{The number of bootstrap replicates to perform.}
}
\value{
A list containing the original estimates (\code{beta_hat}, \code{t_ref}) and data frames for the percentile (\code{per_int}) and studentized (\code{stud_int}) confidence intervals.
}
\description{
Constructs non-parametric confidence intervals for \code{CompReg}
coefficients using bootstrapping.
}
\details{
This function provides a robust method for estimating the uncertainty of the regression coefficients. It implements the standard case resampling bootstrap:
\enumerate{
\item A bootstrap sample is created by drawing \code{n} observations with replacement from the original data (\code{X}, \code{y}).
\item A \code{CompReg} model is fitted to this bootstrap sample.
\item This process is repeated \code{rep} times to generate a distribution of the estimated coefficients and t-statistics.
}

The function calculates two types of 95\% confidence intervals:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Percentile Interval}: The 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrapped coefficient distribution.
\item \strong{Studentized (Pivotal) Interval}: A more accurate interval that uses the distribution of the bootstrapped t-statistic. It is generally preferred for its better statistical properties.
}
