\title{Create a Forest Plot for Compositional Regression Results}
\usage{
CompReg.forest(result, DV.name, class = NULL, width = 30)
}
\arguments{
\item{result}{A single result object for one dependent variable, taken from the list returned by \code{png.CompReg}.}

\item{DV.name}{A string with the name of the dependent variable for the plot title.}

\item{class}{An optional vector of labels for the predictors (clusters).}

\item{width}{An integer to adjust the spacing for the plot layout.}
}
\value{
A \code{forestploter} plot object that can be printed to the graphics device.
}
\description{
Visualizes the results of a compositional regression analysis,
showing the estimated coefficients and their confidence intervals.
}
\details{
This function takes the result from \code{png.CompReg} and creates a forest plot using the \code{forestploter} package. A forest plot is an effective way to display regression results, as it provides a clear visual summary of the magnitude, direction, and uncertainty (confidence interval) of the effect for each predictor. Each row in the plot corresponds to a compositional predictor, with a point estimate and a horizontal line representing the confidence interval. A vertical reference line at zero helps in quickly identifying statistically significant predictors (whose CIs do not cross zero).
