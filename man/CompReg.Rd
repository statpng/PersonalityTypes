\description{
Fits a linear regression model with compositional predictors using a
constrained least-squares approach.

\details{
This function implements the compositional regression model as described in SMMR (Statistical Methods in Medical Research). Compositional predictors (\eqn{X}) are variables that represent proportions of a whole, and thus have a sum-to-k constraint (e.g., sum to 1). Standard OLS is not appropriate for such data.

This model uses log-transformed predictors (\eqn{X_{log} = \log(X)}) and estimates coefficients (\eqn{\beta}) under the constraint that their sum is zero: \eqn{\sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_j = 0}. This constraint ensures model identifiability and allows for proper interpretation of the coefficients. The estimated model is:
\deqn{ y = \mu + X_{log} \beta + \epsilon \quad \text{subject to} \quad \sum \beta_j = 0 }
The coefficient \eqn{\beta_j} is interpreted as the effect of increasing the proportion of component \eqn{j} relative to the geometric mean of all components. The function uses a projection matrix approach to solve this constrained optimization problem and provides estimates for the intercept (\eqn{\mu}), coefficients (\eqn{\beta}), standard errors (\code{se}), and t-statistics (\code{t}).
