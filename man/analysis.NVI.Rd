\title{Analyze Clustering Stability using Normalized Variation of Information (NVI)}
\usage{
analysis.NVI(Xnew, nclust, NEC.mat, top = 20, filename = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Xnew}{The numeric matrix or data frame of observations.}

\item{nclust}{The specific number of clusters to analyze for stability.}

\item{NEC.mat}{The matrix of NEC values produced by \code{analysis.GMM.best}.}

\item{top}{The number of top-performing runs (by NEC) to compare. Default is 20.}

\item{filename}{A base string for output PDF file names.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{VI_matrix}{The pairwise NVI matrix between the top runs.}
\item{Xclust.NVI}{The input data with an appended \code{class} column from the most stable model.}
\item{fit.best.NVI}{The \code{Mclust} object for the most stable model.}
\item{wh.best.NVI}{A vector with the number of clusters and the seed of the most stable model.}
}
\description{
For a fixed number of clusters, this function assesses the stability of
clustering results from different random initializations using NVI.
}
\details{
After determining a candidate for the optimal number of clusters (\code{nclust}), this function evaluates the stability of the clustering solution. It selects the top \code{top} runs (i.e., seeds) for that \code{nclust} based on the lowest NEC values from \code{NEC.mat}.

It then computes the pairwise Normalized Variation of Information (NVI) between the partitions from these top runs. NVI is a measure of distance between two clusterings, with lower values indicating higher similarity.

The function calculates the average NVI for each run against all other top runs. The run with the minimum average NVI is considered the most stable and representative clustering solution.

It generates plots to visualize the stability analysis:
\enumerate{
\item A line plot of the averaged NVI values for each tested seed.
\item Boxplots for the clusterings, ordered by their stability (from most to least stable).
